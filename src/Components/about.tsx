                <p>is german/english brand shoes shop, witch is completely fake and made
                    only for learning purposes. I've created this site with React, react hooks,
                    Redux, SASS, Material-UI, Firebase and Type Script. It is suppose to imitate real shop
                    without it's final chapter - paying console. I was hoping to make quite unique
                    user experience with easy and well understandable steps one have to make to
                    order the product. Implementing database is not finished yet. Enjoy sightseeing.
