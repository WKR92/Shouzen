Shouzen is german/english brand shoes shop, witch is completely fake and made
only for learning purposes. I've created this site with React, react hooks,
Redux, SASS, Material-UI, Firebase and Type Script. It is suppose to imitate real shop
without it's final chapter - paying console. I was hoping to make quite unique
user experience with easy and well understandable steps one have to make to
order the product. Enjoy sightseeing.
